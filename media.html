    <h1>Media Vs Reality:  Music!</h1>
     <h2>who is the target audience and how does it differ from young children teens and adults?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>the target audience is everyone</li>
      <li>childrens music usually has catchy lyrics so the kids will want to buy the music</li>
      <li> for adult music the music usually gives a message that is not very clean and can have bad influences in it</li>
      <li>the same is true for music that is made for teenagers</li>
      </Ul>
    <li> <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w>baby shark(popular kids song)</a></li>
    <li> <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X53ZSxkQ3Ho>Baby got back(popular rap song) teens/adults</a>
     <h2>what messages does the media send that are distorted or even destructive?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>a lot of messages that are distorted can be some things that say drugs are good for you or stuff like that.</li>
        <li>Other messages might make people change the way they look because they see how other people appear or lyrics can tell them how they should look.</li>
       
      </ul>
      
     <h2>what messages does the media send about people's behaviors and their personal choices? </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Some bad music might try to send a message that says that what a person thinks is wrong, incorrect or just plain stupid when there thought or idea might be a good one</li>
        <li>Bad lyrics in music might give people bad influence that a choice they made is wrong. The music might tell them to do something else when, in actuality, the correct thing is the thing that they are doing.</li>
        <li>music can also have bad lyrics that say that someone is ugly or does not look right, they might want to change the way they look, but they look good, and the music was telling them the wrong thing.</li>
      </ul>
     <h2>how is social media involved with music?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>social media is involved in music in many different ways, and people can share music with other people for good reasons and wrong reasons. </li>
        <li>a good reason would be sharing music with people to help boost their spirits and give them life when they are feeling down, for example, a song like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k2d3xIvSMg">let go</a> would be an exceptional example of significant influence.</li>
        <li>a lousy reason for sharing music would be for telling someone they are ugly with music or their choices as I have explained above.</li>
      </ul>
     <h2>what messages does media send about people and their social emotional health?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Music can send great and bad messages about people and their social-emotional health.</li>
        <li>A good message would be songs to help people cope with depression or losses.</li>
        <li>A not so great message would be if someone sent music to someone else that was mean and had nasty lyrics that made the victim sad.</li>
        
      </ul>
