  <h2>
    DNA versus RNA diseases
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are two different types of viruses, DNA viruses and RNA viruses.<br>
    DNA viruses always have pretty much the same shapre because the DNA does not change.<br>
    RNA viruses are the exact opposite, they are unstable and change all the time.<br>
    this makes RNA viruses very hard to make vaccinicnes for them.<br>
    they change because a RNA strand is different then the DNA strand.<br>
    Cholera is a DNA virus.
