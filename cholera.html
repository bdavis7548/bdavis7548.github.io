  <h2>

  <h2>
    DNA versus RNA diseases
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are two different types of viruses, DNA viruses and RNA viruses.<br>
    DNA viruses always have pretty much the same shapre because the DNA does not change.<br>
    RNA viruses are the exact opposite, they are unstable and change all the time.<br>
    this makes RNA viruses very hard to make vaccinicnes for them.<br>
    they change because a RNA strand is different then the DNA strand.<br>
    Cholera is a DNA virus.

   <h2>
    Pathology(what system does cholera affect?)
  </h2>
  <p>
  Cholera mostly affects the digestive system.  it causes infections that produce<br>
  diarreha, which empties a lot of water out of the body system causing massive <br>
  dehydration and sometimes, in bad cases, death.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Symptoms
  </h2>
  <p>
  there are several symptoms of cholera, dirrhea in massive amounts a time.<br>
  Dehydration to point where it is hard to get up and do anything (the dehydration<br>
  is caused by the diarrhea because the diarrhea empties all of the water out of<br>
  your body).  The final sympton is nausea and vomiting.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Transmission
  </h2>
  <p>
  the easiest places to get cholera are in sea water or by eating raw shell fish.<br>
  this is one reason why you should always cook shell fish. if you want to prevent <br>
  cholera then always cook shellfish, or, just don't eat them at all.<br>
