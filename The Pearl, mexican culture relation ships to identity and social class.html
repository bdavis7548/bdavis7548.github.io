      <p>
      The book The Pearl by Jhon Stienbeck is related to social class because it is about the story of a Father, a Mother and a baby boy<br>
      The family is a lower class family,  they do not have very much money.  They live in brush houses in a lower class town with more poor people<br>
      This shows social class becuase the people are all poor and are low class people.  This shows Identity becuase these people are identified by<br>
      not caring about money and loving their family.
