       <h1>The Super Stupid Shark</h1>
       <h3>by Braedyn</h3>
    <p> Once upon a time, there was a shark named sharky he lived in his little shark home in the ocean near the Hawaiian <br>
    The Island Of Kauai,  he lived with his mommy shark and his daddy shark.  They had a very nice life; sharky went to  <br>
     a school that was very close to his house, he was a great student and did very well in shark-studies,  his parents<br>
    expected that he would be able to go to The Supreme Sharky College, which is the best college there is for sharks.<br>
    One day, though, all of those plans got derailed, but before I tell you that story, I have to tell you this story.  <br>
    One day, Sharky went to school. On his way to school, he met his friend, Bob.  Bob was one of the sharky's best friends,<br>
    they did <i><strong>everything</strong></i> together. They met up and started talking, instantly about this <br>
    Girl shark that sharky liked, her name was Angelina, and sharky had a <strong>Humongous</strong> crush on her, these two friends were talking about her right when she walked past them. Angelina asked, "why are you guys talking about me?"<br>
    "Sharky has a crush on you," Bob replied.  "No, I Don't." said sharky.  Angelina quickly ran away.  That same day at <br>
    recess, Sharky noticed Angelina playing with her friends on the coral reefs, "Now's your chance to tell her how you feel,"<br>
    Said Bob.  So, Sharky went over there and said, "Hey Angelina,  I wanted to tell you something," said sharky," yes?"Angelina replied<br>
    "I like you a lot," said sharky,  "I thought so,  I rea-," she was cut off by a gasp.  Sharks were looking up at the water <br>
    Where they noticed a girl surfing the waves.  Bob came over and said to sharky "I dare you to go bite her arm off!",  "no"
    said Sharky, "I'll get in <i>soo</i> much trouble".  "I double-dog dare you," said Bob, everyone gasped.  "No!" Sharky replied.<br>
    "I triple dog dare you." Everyone gasped even louder since no one can argue with a triple dog dare,  Sharky swam up and chomped <br>
    Off the girl's arm.  Everyone Cheered.  The teacher came over to see why all the noise was happening. "What's all this noise about?".<br>
    "Sharky bit off the girl's arm," Screamed Bob.  "Sharky, Your expelled forever!" screamed the teacher. at home, sharky told his parents <br>
    what happened,  "Sharky we are <strong><i>soo</i></strong> disappointed in you".  All of a sudden A fish plopped down right in<br>
   front of them, "oh, look dinner."  Sharky took a bite; the large fishing hook caught on him pulled him up and killed him.  </p>
