    <h1>Scuba Project</h1>
    <h3>By Braedyn Davis</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I read the book Soul Surfer by Bethany Hamilton; This book is an autobiography of Bethany Hamilton's<br>
        life story, this book tells about the time that Bethany Hamilton was out surfing and lost her arm to a shark<br> 
        attack, this book shows how Bethany has dealt with this by turning to god with her troubles.
      </p>
    <h2>My project(creative essay)</h2>
    <p>A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there was a girl named Bethany hamilton.<br> 
       No wait, this was only in 2003 on the Hawaii island of Oahu at the beach, tunnels.<br>
       In 2003 Bethany Hamilton lost her arm to a shark in Hawaii, the beach that she was <br>
       surfing at had never had a recorded shark attack on that beach, this attack was the <br>
       The first one ever recorded at this beach.  Bethany Hamilton has a fascinating life story<br>
       after this attack, she still went on to have a family and become a professional surfer<br>
       That still competes today.  This story <strong><i>Soul Surfer</i></strong> is a great<br>
       story of perseverance and pushing through troubles in life.</p>
